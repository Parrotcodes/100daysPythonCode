# Fizz and Buzz Task
# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".
# And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"
# e.g. it might start off like this:
# 1
# 2
# Fizz
# 4
# Buzz
# Fizz
# 7 ..... 
# FizzBuzz ( 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5)
# .... etc.
